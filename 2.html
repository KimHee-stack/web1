    worship and rest, holding it as the Lord's Day and the day of
    Christ's resurrection. In some Muslim countries and Israel,
    Sunday is the first work day of the week. According to the
    Hebrew calendar and traditional calendars (including Christian
    calendars) Sunday is the first day of the week.
