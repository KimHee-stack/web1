  <h2>vegan village</h2>
  <p>
    Yehuda, like many in this sect of Judaism is not originally from
    Israel but instead immigrated from Washington DC in the United States.
    The Majority of the original village members arrived in the late 60’s
    and 70’s primarily from Chicago.

    Residents of Dimona not only eschew meat and other animal products but also
    alcohol, tobacco and they exercise regularly with monthly massages too.
    Yehuda claims that he and his people started the vegan trend in Israel.
    He may very well be right since when the African Hebrew Israelites arrived
    there were no vegan foods like soy milk, seitan, or tofu available so they
    did what any enterprising vegan would and opened a factory to produce it.
